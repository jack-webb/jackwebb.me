        <h1>Jack Webb</h1>
        <h2>Android Developer at Moneybox</h2>
        <p>Hello! I’m Jack Webb, an Android developer and Computer Science graduate working at <a href="https://moneyboxapp.com/">Moneybox</a>, soon to be based in London. I like building things with Kotlin, Python, and JavaScript, and I love learning new technologies.</p>
        <p>At Moneybox, I'm a Graduate Android Developer. We're a small team working at a rapid pace with a really exciting mission: Enabling everyone to save and invest for their future. Aside from ensuring our app is as good as it can be using modern Android techniques, I'm always looking to learn and improve, be it my own skills or the way we work as a team.</p>
        <p>I completed my degree at <a href="https://aber.ac.uk/en/cs/">Aberystwyth University</a>, where I earned a first class with honours in computer science, with industrial experience. In my second year, I was Treasurer of the AberCompSoc society, organising trips and managing society funds and sponsors. In my first year, I was part of <a href="https://abersailbot.co.uk/">AberSailBot</a>, a student-led robotic sailing team. In both cases I was fortunate enough to learn from some very driven and talented people.</p>
        <p>As part of my degree, I undertook a software development internship at <a href="https://amadeus.com/en">Amadeus</a>, in Frankfurt, Germany. I was working on innovation projects with Softbank's Pepper robot using Kotlin and Android. I was also responsible for some internal event and lecture management tools built with Django and Vue.js. I really enjoyed developing a huge range of new skills, technical and non-technical, in that time.</p>
        <p>The best way to get in touch with me is via email, <a href="mailto:hello@jackwebb.me">hello@jackwebb.me</a>. I'm also on LinkedIn and GitHub.</p>
