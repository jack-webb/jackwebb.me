    <main><h1>Jack Webb</h1>
        <h2>Android Developer at ASOS</h2>
        <p>Hello! I’m Jack Webb, an Android developer and Computer Science graduate working at <a href="https://www.asos.com/">ASOS</a>, based in London. I like building things with Kotlin and Python, and I love learning new technologies. I'm driven by delivering projects that have a tangible impact, and doing so in a clean and pragmatic way.</p>
        <p>At <a href="https://www.asos.com/">ASOS</a>, I'm an Associate Android Developer. We're a rapidly growing team working at scale, expanding the app with new features and into new markets. Aside from ensuring our app is as good as it can be by proposing and using modern Android techniques, I'm always looking to learn and improve, either looking forward at upcoming technologies, or the way I work with the immediate team, and other stakeholders. Also, we're always hiring the best mobile engineers - if that's you, drop me a line and let's chat!</p>
        <p>Previously, I was at <a href="https://www.moneyboxapp.com/">Moneybox</a>. The company has a great mission, and a great team. While there, I owned feature implementations end-to-end, built critical and modular app components, and led showcase sessions on recent developments targeted across the business. I got to work on so many projects with all parts of the company; It was really fun and insightful.</p>
        <p>I completed my degree at <a href="https://aber.ac.uk/en/cs/">Aberystwyth University</a>, where I earned a first class with honours in computer science, with industrial experience. In my second year, I was Treasurer of the AberCompSoc society, organising trips and managing society funds and sponsors. In my first year, I was part of <a href="https://abersailbot.co.uk/">AberSailBot</a>, a student-led robotic sailing team. Both times, I was fortunate enough to learn from some very driven and talented people.</p>
        <p>As part of my degree, I undertook a software development internship at <a href="https://amadeus.com/en">Amadeus</a>, in Frankfurt, Germany. I was working on innovation projects with Softbank's Pepper robot using Kotlin and Android. On top of that, I was also responsible for internal event and lecture management tools built with Django and Vue.js. I really enjoyed developing a huge range of new skills, technical and non-technical, in that time.</p>
        <p>The best way to get in touch with me is via email, <a href="mailto:hello@jackwebb.me">hello@jackwebb.me</a>. I'm also on LinkedIn and GitHub.</p>
